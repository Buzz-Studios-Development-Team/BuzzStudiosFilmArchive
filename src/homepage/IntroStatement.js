            Buzz Studios was chartered in 2001 by a group of students 
            hoping to create a community of filmmakers, storytellers, 
            and artists that would enrich the Georgia Tech campus with 
            its work and its welcoming environment. 22 years in, this 
            mission statement guides us all as we continue to tell the 
            stories of our members.<br/><br/>In order to honor our past and look 
            forward to our future, we have created the Buzz Studios Film 
            Archive, intended to document our club's entire body of work 
            as thoroughly as humanly possible. It is our hope that this 
            website will be maintained well into the future and continue to 
            document the work of Georgia Tech's longest-running filmmaking 
            organization.<br/><br/>- Ethan Ollins, President 2023-2025<br/><br/>
            This archival mission is an ever-ongoing work in progress. Alumni 
            are strongly encouraged to reach out to help us realize this vision.
